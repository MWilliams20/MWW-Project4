Programmer,

Reviewer 2: The program runs, but not as intended. The background pictures are visible, but the text is very difficult to read if it all. Additionally, much of the text that appears on the application is the actual code. This problem is partially due to your line breaks; instead of using "<b>" and "</b>" try using \n with no spaces between the words you want to break. You could also make the text a darker color so it will appear over a multi-colored background. The navigation between windows works with a click anywhere on the app as opposed to a button or a tab, which is a nice touch. Finally, it's unique that you decided to make the application into a player card, but the task was to create a business card. Try including information such as your email address and phone number, or your current employer or past professional experience. The application was only set up to run on Android, so when iOS is enabled the information appears much differently.
